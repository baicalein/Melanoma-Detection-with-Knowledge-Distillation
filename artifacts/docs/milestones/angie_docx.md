Clinical Applications and Impact 

Clinically, our model should be viewed as a high-sensitivity decision-support and pre-screening tool, not a stand-alone diagnostic app [8-12]. Prior primary care and app studies show that prioritizing sensitivity and negative predictive value can minimize false negatives (missed melanomas) but inevitably increases false positives, leading to more referrals and benign biopsies, so our model is best used to flag lesions for clinician review rather than to reassure patients on its own [8,9,12]. Because it was trained on dermoscopic images, its use should be limited to settings where similar dermoscopic photos are available (e.g., primary care with dermatoscopes, teledermatology), as performance may drop on casual smartphone photos taken at home [8–10,12]. In addition, most available datasets over-represent lighter skin types, so equity and generalizability to darker skin tones remain uncertain and require explicit validation [8,10,11]. Finally, any deployment must consider health-system impact (e.g., monitoring model impacts on referral patterns, biopsy rates, and costs to avoid unintended overuse of services) [8,12].
